## Portfolio App

This is my homemade portfolio application.

It is made as a React application, using Typescript and TailwindCss. For animations I've used Framer Motion and simple css transitions.

The main goal of this application, was to motivate myself into creating more projects outside of work, and expand my knowledge overall.

The project can be found hosted on benjaminvoelund.dev, and I will continue to update this, whenever I finish any new projects.

Feel free to give me feedback on this project, by using the 'Contact' feature on the site.
