## Portfolio App

This is my homemade portfolio application.

It is made as a React application, using Typescript and TailwindCss.

The main goal of this application, was to motivate myself into creating more projects outside of work, and expand my knowledge overall.

The project can be found hosted on benjaminvoelund.com, and I will continue to update this, whenever I finish any new projects.
